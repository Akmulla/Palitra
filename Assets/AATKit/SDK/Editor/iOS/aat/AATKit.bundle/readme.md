## UnityAds workarounds

### Frequency capping prevents getting ads

##### Problem:  
If you request ads too often, Unity prevents you from getting ads for a while with a message like this: "AdPlan received with 0 campaigns and refreshDelay 7200"

##### Solution:  
You have to reset the Advertising Identifier (Settings->Privacy->Advertising)
